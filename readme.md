This is a portfolio website with a split page, landing page. At this stage ONLY the Web Development (right side) is active. 
 

Within the Web Development Website, I have used a parallax code which I found on this website:  https://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ 

I adjusted it to fit my preferences and have used the parallax effect on two occasions. The main title picture and in the About Me section. The “parallax1” has an increased scrolling speed which makes it move faster than the text displayed on it. “parallax2” has a negative speed which gives it the effect of appearing and disappearing into itself.  

Also, I fixed the background image, this makes it look as if the text is moving on its own, separately from the background.  


I included two more JavaScript features, one, a Form Validation and a Navigation Menu. 

Both consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript elements.
